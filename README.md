## Description
The goal of this project was to create my first portfolio site, using the Bootstrap framework. Throughout the pages, viewers will notice large gaps of space between the main content of a page and the right side of their respective screens. The goal was to experiment with Bootstraps's grid system and have an column devoid of content that would occupy varying space on the screen as the viewport became smaller. 

The Portolio page on the site contains several placeholder images (essentially black rectangles), which will eventually be replaced by images of later projects. 

Finally, the Contact page contains the beginnings of a form that allows a visitor to enter a name, email, and message, but it does not currently capture the data when a user selects the Submit button. This functionality will be added in a later iteration. 

For now, visitors can contact the author using the email, LinkedIn, or Github icons available in the footer of each page.
