## Description
The goal of this project was to create a portfolio site, using the Bootstrap framework. One of the key aims of this exercise was to experiment with Bootstrap's grid system and create a site that was responsive to a user's screensize. 

The Portolio page ofon the site contains images from recently completed projects. Each image contains a link, taking users to the live application. Each listed project also contains a link to its respective GitHub repository. 

Finally, the Contact page contains the beginnings of a form that allows a visitor to enter a name, email, and message, but it does not currently capture the data when a user selects the Submit button. This functionality will be added in a later iteration. 

For now, visitors can contact the author using the email, LinkedIn, or Github icons available in the footer of each page.
