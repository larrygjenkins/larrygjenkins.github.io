Essentially, I serve as an advisor for my clients, making sure they have the training and tools they need to successfully use our platform. It gives me the opportunity to learn about a variety of businesses, and I enjoy partnering with them to overcome obstacles and craft strategies to help them achieve their goals.</p>
                <p>Prior to my current role, I spent two years as a product manager and became certified as both a scrum master and scrum product owner during that time. I have also worked as a technical writer (for the same software company), and project and operations manager for an environmental consulting firm, and an adjunct professor of journalism.</p>
                <p>It has been a long and winding road with more than a few interesting stops.</p>
                <p>On the educational front, I have both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree from the University of Oklahoma. My undergraduate degree is in music. (I had high hopes going in, but I was amazingly average at the trombone. C’est la vie.) The latter degree was in journalism. (Also, not a great way to make a living, but at least I could hold my own there.)</p>
                <p>More recently, I earned an MBA from Touro University Worldwide, and because I can’t seem to stay away from higher education, I have enrolled in an online coding bootcamp through UC Davis.</p>
                <p>In all seriousness, I love to learn, and this latest educational jaunt has been one of the more challenging and engaging experiences of my academic career. I hope this site grows as I do, and that whoever is reading this will stick around to see how things turn out.</p>
